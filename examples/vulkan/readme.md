Demonstrates a full (although perhaps not best-practice) Vulkan program for rendering a red triangle, using `esd::wnd::VulkanWindow`.

Be sure to run the example from the main project directory (with "./build/examples/vulkan/eseed_window_example_vulkan") as the executable needs to read spv files in a certain folder for creating the shader modules.
